## [1.4.11] - 2026-04-17

### Highlights

- **End-to-end test of the new in-app updater** — 1.4.11 is the first
  release that existing 1.4.1 installs are expected to pick up and
  install **fully automatically** (download → silent install →
  auto-relaunch) via `electron-updater` and the silent one-click NSIS
  package shipped in 1.4.1.
- **`electron-builder` bumped 25 → 26.8.1**, which pulls in fixed
  versions of `tar`, `cacache`, `glob`, `@electron/rebuild`, and
  friends, eliminating **11 of 12 `npm audit` advisories** in the
  build tree (all of them dev-only transitive deps).
- **Release notes are now generated from `CHANGELOG.md`** instead of
  being hardcoded in the workflow. The CI reads the `## [X.Y.Z]`
  section that matches the pushed tag and uses it as the GitHub
  release body, so future releases always advertise the actual
  changes that shipped.
- Release body additionally describes the three asset families
  (installer, updater metadata, standalone zip) so users don't try to
  run `latest.yml` or the `.blockmap`.

### Known

- The single remaining `npm audit` advisory is against **Electron 33**
  itself (multiple moderate / high CVEs fixed in Electron 38.8.6 /
  39.8.5). Bumping Electron is a semver-major update and is deferred
  to a dedicated release rather than bundled here, so that the
  updater flow can be validated against a minimally-changed build.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed — Updater (critical fix)

- Replaced the custom GitHub-releases updater with `electron-updater`.
  The previous implementation downloaded the installer and spawned it
  as a detached child process, but the install wizard often never
  became visible (UAC or wizard interactions), leaving the app stuck
  on "Restarting..." without actually updating.
- NSIS installer switched to **silent one-click** mode:
  - `oneClick: true` (no wizard pages)
  - `perMachine: false` (installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ZeusMod`,
    no UAC prompt)
  - `runAfterFinish: true` (app auto-launches after install)
- CI now publishes `latest.yml` + installer blockmap alongside the
  installer so `electron-updater` can discover the latest release and
  support differential downloads.
- `update:install` IPC now calls `autoUpdater.downloadUpdate()` +
  `autoUpdater.quitAndInstall(isSilent=true, isForceRunAfter=true)` —
  the install is silent and the app re-launches automatically.

### Migration note

- Users already running v1.3.x or v1.4.0 must perform **one last
  manual download** of `ZeusMod-Setup-1.4.1.exe` from the Releases
  page (the old in-app updater cannot reliably hand off to the new
  installer). After installing 1.4.1 manually, every subsequent
  update is fully automatic.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added — Survival

- **Stable Temperature** toggle clamps the player's
  `SurvivalCharacterState::ModifiedInternalTemperature` every tick to a
  configurable integer value (default 20°C). This is the exact int the HUD
  thermometer reads, so the player is no longer affected by hot biomes,
  cold storms, night drops, or altitude.

### Added — Progression

- **Mega Exp** grants `+50 000` XP per tick on
  `PlayerCharacterState::TotalExperience` so the character levels up
  visibly through the game's own level-up gates instead of jumping to
  max in one frame.

### Added — Plumbing

- `ResolveAllOffsets()` now resolves
  `SurvivalCharacterState::ModifiedInternalTemperature`,
  `PlayerCharacterState::TotalExperience`, and `Controller::PlayerState`
  through `UObjectLookup::FindPropertyOffset`.
- `FindPlayer()` caches the `PlayerState` pointer alongside the existing
  character / actor state pointers so progression features don't have to
  re-walk the world graph every tick.
- In-game overlay grows from 10 to 12 toggle rows (OVL_H 432 → 484) and
  the renderer + hit-test tables are driven by a single `OVL_ROW_COUNT`
  constant to avoid two-loop drift in future edits.
- Desktop UI gets a new **PROGRESSION** category (Mega Exp) and a new
  **Stable Temperature** row under **SURVIVAL**.
- Pipe protocol gains new commands: `temp`, `temp_val`, `megaexp`.

### Changed

- Bumped desktop app to **1.4.0**.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- In-app updater: clicking **Download and install** now actually launches
  the downloaded NSIS installer instead of silently killing it. The previous
  build called `execFile(installer, [], { detached: true, windowsHide: true })`
  immediately followed by `app.quit()`, which:
  - left the child's stdio pipes attached to the parent (`stdio: 'pipe'` by
    default), so the installer process was torn down with the Electron app,
  - and applied `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (`windowsHide: true`) on a GUI installer,
    which can suppress the NSIS wizard window.
  The handler now uses `stdio: 'ignore'` and calls `child.unref()` so the
  installer survives the parent quitting and its UAC + wizard UI appears
  normally. After clicking **Finish**, the NSIS *Run ZeusMod* checkbox
  (default on) relaunches the new version.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- The packaged `ZeusMod.exe` now actually carries the ZeusMod icon. The
  previous build set `signAndEditExecutable: false` in the electron-builder
  config, which silently disabled `rcedit` and prevented the icon from
  being embedded into the executable resource section. Removing that flag
  lets electron-builder embed the icon, so the desktop shortcut, taskbar,
  Start Menu and Explorer file icon all show ZeusMod artwork.
- The bundled `.ico` is now a true multi-resolution icon
  (16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 128 / 256), so Windows picks a crisp size in
  every context instead of downscaling 256 → 16.

### Changed

- Bumped desktop app to **1.3.1**.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- Free Craft now works on **0 / N** recipes — the crafting UI accepts inputs
  the player does not own, and the validation chain is bypassed end-to-end
  (`CanQueueItem`, `HasSufficientResource`, `GetResourceRecipeValidity`,
  `CanSatisfyRecipeQueryInput`).
- Player-owned inventory filter on the item-count hooks: only the local
  player's `Inventory` returns the unlimited fake count, so deployable
  inventories (extractors, processors, benches) keep their real contents and
  outputs are delivered correctly.
- Tick subsystem auto-registration: when the queued recipe context is missing
  from `DeployableTickSubsystem`'s active processor list, ZeusMod inserts a
  valid `FWeakObjectPtr { ObjectIndex, SerialNumber }` into the unreflected
  `+0x60` `TArray`, and processing proceeds normally.
- `ProcessingItem` pre-populator: when `AddProcessingRecipe` runs while the
  game's internal `ValidateQueueItem` would have rejected the queue entry,
  ZeusMod copies the queued slot into `ProcessingItem` (`+0x1C0`) so the
  in-game `Process` tick can advance progress.
- Embedded ZeusMod application icon (256×256) wired into:
  - the Electron `BrowserWindow`
  - the NSIS installer header / installer icon / uninstaller icon
  - the desktop shortcut and Start Menu entry
- Companion app now ships the **latest** internal DLL and external injector
  inside `app/bin/`, plus the PowerShell remote-thread injector in
  `app/scripts/inject.ps1`, so a fresh install is fully self-contained.

### Changed

- Bumped the desktop app to **1.3.0** (`package.json`, `BrowserWindow`,
  installer artifact name).
- The DLL injection IPC handler now points at `bin/IcarusInternal.dll` and
  `scripts/inject.ps1` from the packaged resources directory rather than the
  development tree, so the installed app no longer depends on repo paths.
- README rewritten as a user-facing GitHub-style document with feature list,
  architecture diagram, build steps, screenshots and changelog reference.

### Fixed

- Crash on inject caused by patching an out-of-range probe address: the
  installer for byte patches now validates that the target falls inside the
  module's plausible code range before writing.
- `__try` / `__except` mixed with C++ object unwinding (C2712): isolated raw
  memory probes into helper functions that do not construct C++ objects.
- Script VM reentrance crash (`UObject::CallFunction` with
  `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`) when re-entering UFunction thunks from a hook —
  the affected re-entry path is now avoided and replaced with direct context
  manipulation.

### Patch resilience

- All UFunction entry points are still resolved at runtime by **name** via
  `UObjectLookup::FindNativeFunction` (UE reflection). UPROPERTY offsets are
  still resolved at runtime through the FField chain. Most game updates
  should not require a rebuild.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Unified solution layout around `Shared`, `IcarusInjector`, and
  `IcarusInternal`.
- Professionalized Electron update flow with explicit update state reporting,
  release-note display, manual re-check support, installer download progress
  and a release-page fallback.
- English-only desktop UI strings and English-only ImGui overlay strings for
  the active runtime menu.

### Changed

- Refined the Electron app header to expose update status and a manual check
  action.
- Reworked the update modal into a clearer release workflow.
- Rewrote the top-level documentation for the current project layout and
  active build path.
- Archived deprecated assets into `NotUsed/`.

### Removed

- `IcarusTrainer` from the active solution.
- Retired tools, SDK dumps, and old root offset artifacts (moved to
  `NotUsed/`).

## Earlier repository state

Before the 1.2.0 cleanup pass, the repository still contained archived SDK
dump material at the top level, an unused trainer project in the active
solution, and outdated references to older AOB-generation tooling in the
main tree. Those assets are preserved under `NotUsed/`.
